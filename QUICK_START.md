# Quick Start: From Zero to Published GitHub Action

## TL;DR - 3 Commands to Deploy

```bash
# 1. Create and push repository
gh repo create cloudshipai/station-action --public
cd ~/projects && git clone https://github.com/cloudshipai/station-action.git
cd station-action
cp -r ~/projects/hack/station/dev-workspace/github-action-template/* .
git add . && git commit -m "Initial release" && git push

# 2. Create release
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Initial release" && git push origin v1.0.0
git tag -a v1 -m "v1 latest" && git push origin v1

# 3. Publish to Marketplace
# Go to: https://github.com/cloudshipai/station-action/releases/new
# Click "Publish this Action to the GitHub Marketplace"
```

## What You Get

### A 3-Line GitHub Action

**Users add this to their workflows:**
```yaml
- uses: cloudshipai/station-action@v1
  with:
    agent: infrastructure-security
```

**That's it. No Docker knowledge required.**

### What Happens Under the Hood

1. Action pulls `ghcr.io/cloudshipai/station-security:latest`
2. Mounts user's workspace
3. Runs agent with 97+ security tools
4. AI analyzes findings
5. Posts PR comment with results

### Available Agents (Already in Your Image)

1. **Infrastructure Security Auditor** - Terraform, K8s, Docker scanning
2. **PR Security Reviewer** - Code review for security issues
3. **Supply Chain Guardian** - SBOM + dependency vulnerabilities
4. **Deployment Security Gate** - Pre-deployment validation
5. **Security Improvement Advisor** - Proactive recommendations
6. **Security Metrics Reporter** - KPI tracking and reporting

## Testing Before Publishing

```bash
# Create test repo
gh repo create cloudshipai/test-action --public

# Add test workflow
mkdir -p .github/workflows
cat > .github/workflows/test.yml << 'EOF'
name: Test
on: push
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: cloudshipai/station-action@main  # Test with main branch first
        with:
          agent: infrastructure-security
        env:
          OPENAI_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}
EOF

gh secret set OPENAI_API_KEY
git add . && git commit -m "Test workflow" && git push

# Watch it run
gh run watch
```

## Key Features That Make This Win

### 1. Simple Interface
```yaml
with:
  agent: infrastructure-security  # Easy to understand
```

vs current:
```yaml
docker run --rm --privileged \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  -v ${{ github.workspace }}:/workspace \
  -e OPENAI_API_KEY="${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}" \
  ghcr.io/cloudshipai/station-security:latest \
  bash -c "stn sync default -i=false && stn agent run 'Infrastructure Security Auditor' 'Long task description...' --tail"
```

### 2. Agent Discovery
Users can see available agents in README, no need to know Docker internals.

### 3. Smart Defaults
- Default agent: infrastructure-security (most common use case)
- Default task: Sensible for each agent
- Auto PR comments: Enabled by default
- Fail on critical: Disabled by default (won't break builds unexpectedly)

### 4. Customization When Needed
```yaml
with:
  agent: infrastructure-security
  task: "Focus only on AWS security groups"
  fail_on_critical: true
```

### 5. Works Everywhere
Same Docker image works in:
- GitHub Actions (this action)
- GitLab CI (docker run)
- CircleCI (docker run)
- Jenkins (docker run)
- Local (docker run)

## Marketing Copy

**GitHub Marketplace Description:**
```
AI-powered security scanning for your CI/CD pipeline. 97+ tools, 6 specialized agents,
3 lines of YAML. Scan infrastructure (Terraform, K8s, Docker), code, and dependencies
with AI analysis. Get security findings directly in PR comments.
```

**Tagline:**
```
Add AI security scanning in 2 minutes
```

**Value Props:**
- âœ… 97+ security tools in one integration
- âœ… AI-powered analysis and prioritization
- âœ… 3 lines to add to any workflow
- âœ… Automatic PR comments
- âœ… No complex configuration

## Pricing Strategy

**The Action:** Free and open source

**What Users Pay For:**
- OpenAI API usage (~$0.10-$0.50 per scan)
- GitHub Actions minutes (free tier: 2,000 min/month)

**Why This Works:**
- Low barrier to entry (try it for pennies)
- Pay-as-you-go (scales with usage)
- No vendor lock-in (open source action)
- Value is clear (saves hours of setup time)

## Success Metrics

**Week 1 Target:**
- 100 installations
- 10 GitHub stars
- 5 issues/discussions

**Month 1 Target:**
- 1,000 installations
- 500 GitHub stars
- Active community (20+ issues/discussions)

**Month 3 Target:**
- 5,000 installations
- 2,000 GitHub stars
- Featured in GitHub blog/newsletter

## What Makes This Different

### vs Snyk/SonarQube/etc.
- âœ… One action vs 5-10 different integrations
- âœ… AI analysis vs simple rule matching
- âœ… Multi-domain (IaC + code + dependencies) vs specialized

### vs GitHub Security Features
- âœ… 97 tools vs ~5 tools
- âœ… Customizable vs fixed rules
- âœ… AI-powered vs static analysis

### vs Other GitHub Actions
- âœ… Integrated suite vs individual tools
- âœ… Consistent interface vs 10 different config formats
- âœ… AI analysis vs raw tool output

## Next Steps After Launch

**Immediate (Week 1):**
- [ ] Post on HackerNews ("Show HN: AI Security Scanning for GitHub Actions")
- [ ] Post on Reddit r/devops, r/netsec
- [ ] Tweet/LinkedIn announcement
- [ ] Email to early adopters

**Short-term (Month 1):**
- [ ] Blog post: "How to Add Security Scanning in 2 Minutes"
- [ ] Video demo (3-5 minutes)
- [ ] Reach out to DevSecOps influencers
- [ ] Submit to GitHub Security newsletter

**Medium-term (Month 3):**
- [ ] GitHub App (zero-config installation)
- [ ] Custom bundle support
- [ ] GitLab CI adapter
- [ ] Dagger module

**Long-term (Month 6+):**
- [ ] Self-hosted option
- [ ] Enterprise features (SSO, audit logs)
- [ ] Slack/Discord integrations
- [ ] Compliance reporting (SOC2, ISO27001)

## The Winning Formula

**Current Reality:**
Setting up security scanning = 10 hours of work, 5 integrations, ongoing maintenance

**With CloudShip AI Station:**
```yaml
- uses: cloudshipai/station-action@v1
  with:
    agent: infrastructure-security
```
= 2 minutes, 1 integration, automatic updates

**That's a 300x improvement in developer experience.**

## Ready to Launch?

1. **Copy files** to new repo
2. **Create release** with v1.0.0
3. **Publish** to GitHub Marketplace
4. **Announce** on social media
5. **Monitor** and iterate

The action is production-ready. The Docker image works. The agents are proven.

**All that's left is to ship it! ðŸš€**
